# System Requirements
This page provides detailed hardware, software, and platform requirements to help you set up and run the application efficiently.


<!--
## User Stories Addressed
- **US-2: Evaluating System Requirements**
  - **As a developer**, I want to review the hardware and software requirements, so that I can determine if my environment supports the application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. A detailed table of hardware requirements (e.g., processor type, memory).
2. A list of software dependencies and supported operating systems.
3. Clear guidance on compatibility issues.
-->

## Supported Platforms

<!--
**Guidelines**:
- Include supported operating systems, versions, and platform-specific notes.
-->
**Operating Systems**
- Ubuntu OS version 24.04.1 LTS
<!--
**Hardware Platforms**
- Intel® Core™ processors (Intel® Core™ i5 processor or higher)
- Intel® Xeon® processors (recommended for large deployments)
-->


## Minimum Requirements
| **Component**       | **Minimum**                        | **Recomended**                      |     
|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Processor**       | 11th Gen Intel® Core™ Processor    | Intel® Core™ Ultra 7 Processor 155H |
| **Memory**          | 8 GB                               | 8 GB                                |
| **Disk Space**      | 256 GB SSD                         | 256 GB SSD                          | 
| **GPU/Accelerator** | Intel® UHD Graphics                | Intel® Arc™ Graphics                |


## Software Requirements
**Required Software**:
- Docker Engine version 20.10 or higher

- Ensure the device has the required drivers. If not, follow the steps in [Edge Device Enablement Framework](https://docs.edgeplatform.intel.com/edge-device-enablement-framework/user-guide/Get-Started-Guide.html).

## Compatibility Notes
<!--
**Guidelines**:
- Include any limitations or known issues with supported platforms.
-->
**Known Limitations**:
- GPU compute engine utilization metric require Intel® Graphics. 
- When there are multiple GPUs in the system, the collector collects GPU metrics for the discrete GPU. 


## Validation
- Ensure all dependencies are installed and configured before proceeding to [Get Started](./get-started.md).
